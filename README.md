R for Reproducible Agricultural Analysis
======================================

An introduction to R for non-programmers using agricultural data.

The goal of these lessons is to teach novice programmers to write modular code
and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many
scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party
packages. The emphasis of these materials is to give
attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best
practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units,
task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop focuses on the fundamentals of the programming
language R, and not on statistical analysis.

The lesson contains more material than can be taught in a day.  The [instructor notes page]({{ page.root }}/guide) has some suggested lesson plans suitable for a one or half day workshop.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

These lessons are adapted from the Software Carpentry's [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder), which is currently maintained by [David Mawdsley](https://software-carpentry.org/team/#mawdsley_david), [Jeff Oliver](https://software-carpentry.org/team/#oliver_jeffrey), [Tom Wright](https://software-carpentry.org/team/#wright_thomas), and [Naupaka Zimmerman](https://software-carpentry.org/team/#zimmerman_naupaka)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

There are some amazing plotting packages written - ggplot and a large ecosystem of ggplot extensions and so much more. But, with great visualisation power, comes great coding effort. 

There is value in knowing base plotting - these are rapid ways to gain a snapshot of data and can be made publication quality.

## Univariate plots

### index scatterplot

### histogram density plot

## Multivariate plots

### X-Y plots

### barplot

### boxplot

## mess with settings

## add things...

Legend

```{r}
x<-1:10; y1=x*x; y2=2*y1
plot(x, y1, type="b", pch=19, col="red", xlab="x", ylab="y")
# Add a line
lines(x, y2, pch=18, col="blue", type="b", lty=2)
# Add a legend
legend(1, 95, legend=c("Line 1", "Line 2"),
       col=c("red", "blue"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8)
```

Lines
abline()

Text
special characters
# main = expression(paste("Sampled values, ", mu, "=5, ", sigma, "=1")

### Challenge 1

Filter CO2 data set for all observation with growth greater than the median. Do the same for growth greater than the mean. How do these differ? 

### Challenge 2

Calculate the harvest index (yield / unit area) for alfalfa, filter for the top 10% and bottom 10% and sort the results. Do any pattern emerge for year or state? 

### Challenge 3

Write a function that computes the correlation coefficient, `cor()` for yields for one year compared to another yield. Use From the hay data set, select rows which occur on 10-year increments (e.g. 1920, 1940, etc).

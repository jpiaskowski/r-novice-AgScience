## Plotting with Base R

### Challenge 1

For this workshop, the following were the final counts for registrants:

AVS: 14  
EPPN: 12  
Plant Science: 10  
Soil and Water: 9  
Food Science: 5  
Extension: 5  
Other: 3  

Calculate the percentage of each relative to totol registrants. Plot those results in a barplot. 
**Hint:** use `sum()`

### Challenge 2

Filter the hay data set for 2 states and make a scatter plot comparing the reported annual yield of one state with that of the second. 

Bonus: add vertical and horizontal lines indicates the means for the x and y variables, respectively

### Challenge 3

Convert challenge 2 into an R function that will work for any two U.S. states listed in the hay data set.

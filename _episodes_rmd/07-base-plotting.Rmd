## Exploratory Data Analysis

There are some amazing plotting packages written - ggplot and a large ecosystem of ggplot extensions and so much more. But, with great visualisation power, comes great coding effort. 

There is value in knowing base plotting - these are rapid ways to gain a snapshot of data and can be made publication quality.

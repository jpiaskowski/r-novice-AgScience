## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start this process using R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. This example starts with agricultural datasets that are publically available. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the change in yield for a crop over time? Can you calculate the mean acreage of a crop for each U.S. state? By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

[Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Introduction to RStudio

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management.


**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or 
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 
> 3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux 
> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate, print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then returns a result.

## Project and file management

Undoubtedly, you've seen some outrageous file managment schemes. You may even be implementing one. However, there are some guidelines on how to optimally order your files. One of the best ways to organise your files is to create dedicated sub-directory for a research project. 

Rprojects can be used to automate what directory R looks to for loading and saving files. Rprojects also enable version control through Git or other versioning software. 

**Step 1**: download all course materials: 
```
library(usethis)
use_course("...")
```
**Step 2:** make a new Rproject in that directory: "File" --> "New Project" --> "Existing Directory" 

Let's check the working directory to make sure it's pointing to the right place:
```{r}
getwd()
```
If the working directory needs to be set, this can be done on the command line with `setwd()` or within RStudio: "Session" --> "Set Working Directory" --> "Choose Directory..." 

**Step 3**: make your first script: File --> New File --> R Script
We will use this R script for our work today. 

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
> to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 1. Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 1. Exponents: `^` or `**`
 1. Divide: `/`
 1. Multiply: `*`
 1. Add: `+`
 1. Subtract: `-`

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you intend.

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions. Remember that others (or most likey, future you) may later read your code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```


The text after each line of code is called a "comment". Anything that follows after the pound sign `#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4` is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function, we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses. Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's arguments:

```{r}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r}
log10(10) # base 10 logarithm
```

```{r}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can simply look them up on Google, or if you can remember the start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page for that command. As well as providing a detailed description of the command and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r}
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

These print out either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Both are reserved words (along with `T` and `F`) meaning that cannot be used alone as an object name. These types of comparisons that result in either

> ## Tip: Comparing Numbers
>
> A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
> never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are
> integers (a data type which can specifically represent
> only whole numbers).
>
> Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a
> certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look
> the same when printed out by R, may actually have
> different underlying representations and therefore be
> different by a small margin of error (called Machine
> numeric tolerance).
>
> Instead you should use the `all.equal` function.

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorised*, meaning that variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the same data type. For example: 

```{r}
1:5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x
```

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an upcoming lesson.

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors
>
> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there are over 10,000 packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) (the comprehensive R archive network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

## Version Control

It is important to use version control with projects.  Go [here for a good lesson which describes using Git with RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/).

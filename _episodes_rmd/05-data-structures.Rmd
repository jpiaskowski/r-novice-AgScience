At this point, you've seen it all: in the last lesson, we toured all the basic data types in R. Everything you do will be a manipulation of those types. Now we need to look at *data structures* - that is, a more complex structure which R builds out of the basic data types.

But most of the time, the star of the show is the data frame - which is quite similar to an Microsoft Excel sheet. It is type automatically used when an external data set is imported into R. In this lesson, we will learn a few more things about working with data frames.

But, first we need to learn how to load data. One of R's most powerful features is its ability to deal with tabular data - such as you may already have in a spreadsheet or a CSV file.

The `read.table()` function is used for reading in tabular data stored in a text file where the columns of data are separated by punctuation characters such as CSV files (csv = comma-separated values). Tabs and commas are the most common punctuation characters used to separate or delimit data points in csv files.  For convenience R provides 2 other versions of `read.table()`. These are: `read.csv()` for files where the data are separated with commas and `read.delim()` for files where the data are separated with tabs. Of these three functions, `read.csv()` is the most commonly used.  

Okay, let's read some data in! First,we load a data set of pig growth under different feeds. 

```{r}
pig_feed <- read.csv("data/pig_feed_trial.csv")
```

Looking at the environment tab, we can see there are 50 rows of 5 variables. By clicking on the small arrow next to the object name, more information about the variables can be seen.
![RStudio env tab](../fig/env_tab.png)


Let's examine the data manually by clicking on the object name in the "Environment" pane. The data can be sorted by individual columns. Data frames are collections of vectors - that is each column is a single data type.  

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our data.

We can begin exploring columns in our data set by pulling out columns by specifying them using the `$` operator:

```{r}
weight <- pig_feed$weight2
weight
```

>**Tip**: you an also use `[[` to extract *a single column* from a 
>data frame: 
>```
>pig_feed[["weight2"]]
>```

Compute some summary statistics on that: 
```{r}
mean(weight)
median(weight)
min(weight); max(weight)
# range(weight) obains both the min and max    
var(weight)
sd(weight)
summary(weight)
```
 
Or run`summary()`on the entire data frame and use `head()`to view the top 6 rows.
```{r}
head(pig_feed)
summary(pig_feed)
```

Let's see what is going on in those factors with the function `levels()`;
```{r}
levels(pig_feed$treatment)
levels(pig_feed$rep)
table(pig_feed$rep) # to see counts for each level
```

> **Tip**: When working with a character variables, the function `levels()` will return 
> nothing. Use `unique()` to find the unique levels. 

Data frames do have a length, but it more clearly described by `ncol()`, `nrow()`, or `dim()`. It also has `rownames()`and `colnames` attributes.
```{r}
ncol(pig_feed)
nrow(pig_feed) 
dim(pig_feed) 
colnames(pig_feed)
```

If you don't specify the row names during import, then the `read.csv()` function will create an index of integers from 1 to the end of the data frame for row numbers. 

The column and row names are vectors. As such, they can be indexed to access a particular item. To rename a column, index it. Since "weight1" is probably the initial weight of each pig, let's rename it. 

```{r}
colnames(pig_feed)[3] <- "init_wt"
```

## Indexing Data Frames

Because, unlike vectors, data frames are in 2 dimensions and are indexed with 2 numbers using a `dataframe[row, column]` notation.  To access rows and keep all columns, leave the second number slot blank. Otherwise, the usual rules apply as for indexing vectors. 

```{r}
pig_feed[1,] # just look at row 1
pig_feed[11:20, ] # look at rows 11 - 20
pig_feed[c(1, 25, 50), ] # look at rows 1, 25, and 50
```

This is called a "slice". 

Likewise, to keep all rows and but select columns, keep the row slot empty:
```{r}
pig_feed[,4]
```
What happens if you try to index past the number of rows or columns? 

Column indexing is particular helpful for reordering columns and omitting columns:
```{r}
pig_feed_reduc <- pig_feed[, c(1, 5, 4, 3)] # reorder columns, omitting column 2
```

Negative indexing removes observation. 
```{4 eval=F}
pig_feed[-1,] # removes row 1
pig_feed[, -1] # remove column 1
```

## Adding Columns to Data Frames

Vectors with the same length as the number of rows in the data set can be added using the `$` operator. Vector recycling also works in this context.
```{r}
pig_feed$new_var <- 1:nrow(pig_feed)
pig_feed$change <- pig_feed$weight2 - pig_feed$init_wt
pig_feed$year <- 2019
```

The `cbind()` function is also useful for combining data frames with the same number of rows. You must be certain that the row orders match, as R will not check. 

```{r}
pig_feed_Col <- cbind(pig_feed, pig_feed)
```

Now we have duplicate column names, which R does allow. 

Note that if we tried to add a vector with a different number of entries than the number of rows in the dataframe, it would fail. R wants to see one element in our new column
for every row in the table:

Now how about adding rows? The `rbind()`function works in the same way as `cbind()`, except that rows of a data frame are lists:

```{r}
newRow <- list("T9", "R1", 25, 650, 200, 51, 170, 2019)
pig_feed_Row <- rbind(pig_feed, newRow)
```

Looks like our attempt to use the `rbind()` function returns a warning.  Recall that, unlike errors, warnings do not necessarily stop a function from performing its intended action.  You can confirm this by taking a look at the data frame with the function.

```{r}
tail(pig_feed_Row)
```

Notice that not only did we successfully add a new row, but there is `NA` in the column "treatment" where we expected "T9" to be.  Why did this happen?

## Factors

For an object containing the data type `factor`, each different value represents what is called a `level`. In our case, the `factor` "treatment" has 5 levels: "T1", "T1", "T3", "T4", and "T5". R will only accept values that match one of the levels. If you add a new value, it will become `NA`.

One way to  fix that is to change a factor into a character vector; we lose the handy categories of the factor, but we can subsequently add any new character string to the column without errors:

```{r}
pig_feed$treatment <- as.character(pig_feed$treatment)
pig_feed_Row <- rbind(pig_feed, newRow)
```

## Removing Rows & Columns

We already know that  rows and columns can be removed by indexing with negative numbers, or by selectively indexing a data frame. 

```{r}
pig_feed[-(1:45), ] # remove rows 1-40
pig_feed[c(-(1:45), -3), ] # remove rows 1-40
```

Alternatively, we can drop all rows with `NA` values:

```{r}
pig_feed_na <- na.omit(pig_feed)
```

We can also remove columns in our data frame in the same fashion. 


> ## Miscellaneous Tips
>
> * Another type of file you might encounter are tab-separated value files (.tsv). To specify a tab as a separator, use `"\\t"` or `read.delim()`.
>
> * Files can also be downloaded directly from the Internet into a local
> folder of your choice onto your computer using the `download.file` function.
> The `read.csv` function can then be executed to read the downloaded file from the download location, for example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")
> gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
> ```
>
> * Alternatively, you can also read in files directly into R from the Internet by replacing the file paths with a web address in `read.csv`. One should note that in doing this no local copy of the csv file is first saved onto your computer. For example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv")
> ```
>
> * You can read directly from excel spreadsheets without
> converting them to plain text first by using the [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html) package.
